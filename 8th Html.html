            <h2>Today is "national take Your Dog to Work Day"</h2>
            <p>
                If you's lucky enough to work from home, every day is "Take Your Dog to work Day." 
                But most people aren't, so today is the one day a year that many companies allow 
                their empolyees to bring their pups with them. Some workplaces are so fantasitic 
                that dogs are welcome all year round! While it's obviously not recommended for dogs
                to be brought to woek sites that are dangerous for them or where they'll get in the 
                way, such as an operating room or a factory floor, offices can be the perfect 
                environment for pets.

                <h2>Japanese foods we love-Sushi</h2>
                <p>Without a doubt, sushi is one of Japan's greatest gastronomical 
                    gifts to the world. Almost poetic in its simplicity, good sushi 
                    relies on two things: the freshness of the ingredients and the 
                    knife skills of the chef. Whether you like your raw fish draped 
                    over bite-sized balls of vinegared rice, rolled up in toasted 
                    nori seaweed or pressed into fat rectangular logs, delicious 
                    sushi can be found in every price range.The sushi at Sushisho 
                    Masa in Roppongi is nothing short of perfection. At around 
                    Â¥20,000 ($200) per person, it's a splurge, but perfection doesn't
                    come cheap.</p>

                <h2>New York City's best rooftop bars</h2>
                <p>
                    There's something about being far above the hubbub of the Big Apple's 
                streets, especially in the summertime, when humidity levels soar and 
                the concrete feels like it's emanating heat waves. "Being on a New York 
                City rooftop gives you this special pleasure of feeling part of the city, 
                inside it, but at a distance," says Ray Chung, director of design at 
                The Johnson Studio, the firm behind the rooftop lounge at The Wit Hotel 
                in Chicago, among other projects."Walking down the streets is one thing, 
                but being able to let your guard down and see the city reduced in 
                size -- all the while still breathing the same air and still hearing 
                the buzz of the city -- it can be intoxicating," says Chung.

                        Gaggan was sitting in a Singapore ballroom attending the Asia's 
                        50 Best Restaurant Awards, waiting in agony to find out 
                        whether his eponymous Bangkok-based restaurant could hold 
                        onto the number three spot it grabbed last year "As they got 
                        to five, then four, and my name hadn't been called, I thought 
                        'that means I'm three again ... at least we matched our success, 
                        at least we're on the right track," he says."When they were about 
                        to call number two and I still hadn't been called up, I thought 
                        'If I'm number one, I'll try not to cry.'

                <h2>The best things to do and see in Newport</h2>
                <p>
                    Many of those cliches about postcard-pretty coastal New England 
                    towns got their start in the same place: Newport, Rhode Island.
                    The town is best known for being a summer getaway for America's 
                    aristocracy during the Gilded Age, with wealthy families like the 
                    Vanderbilts, the Dukes and Astors all owning summer homes there 
                    (they say "cottage," we say "ginormous mansion") and throwing 
                    glamorous parties.Although more of the luxurious estates are 
                    museums than homes these days, Newport hasn't lost its seaside 
                    charm -- especially in the summer. Here's our guide to the best 
                    things to do, eat and explore both indoors and out.
